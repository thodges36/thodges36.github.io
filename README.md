### Homework from 06-ajax

I've attempted to create a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice via the Giphy Api. At a high level, the page should display current buttons from an array, add new buttons entered via the form shown on the page, dispay gifs when the user clicks on the button, and - when the user clicks on the gif - the gifs' states are started and stopped.

Unfortunately, after several commits shown in GitHub, I've been able to do many of the functionality requirements (rendering buttons new and existing, displaying gifs, etc.) but I'm not able to combine all of those individual elements into a working web page.
